=====================================================================
Transitive Grace Period Public Licence ("TGPPL") v. 2.0 Rough Draft 1
=====================================================================

This work is under GPLv3 with the following added permission:

=================================
Transitive Grace Period EXCEPTION
=================================

Version 0.1, 2015-03-18Z

Copyright © 2015 Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This Transitive Grace Period Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given work (the "Work") that bears a
notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the
file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow you to delay the
GPL-licensing of the source code of a derived work of The Work for a
limited time.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

   You have permission to delay the GPL-licensing of the source code
   of a derived work of The Work for up to 12 months from the time
   that the GPLv3 (section 5) would otherwise require you to
   GPL-license the derived work.

2. No Weakening of The Work's Copyleft.

   The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
   presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
   requirements of the license of The Work.


.. Note: there is a subtlety that I care about it, and I would
   appreciate it if you would help me make sure not to accidentally
   obliterate it. Quoting myself from an old thread on the
   license-discuss mailing list:

   I'm willing to allow a line of works licensed under TGPPL to
   eventually give rise to derived works licensed under GPL. However
   there is a specific thing that I'm unwilling to allow: that if I
   make a work available to you under TGPPL, that you take advantage
   of the 12 month grace period for keeping your derived work
   proprietary, and then deny the grace period option to derivors
   immediately downstream from you.

   I currently think it is possible to achieve both of the above in a
   future version of TGPPL, by saying: this is my work, it is licensed
   to you under TGPPL, the TGPPL stipulates that you can use my work
   only if you either (a) license your derived work under GPL
   *immediately* (just as standard GPL requires), or (b) license your
   derived work under TGPPL within 12 months.
