Transitive Grace Period EXCEPTION
=================================

Version 0.1, 2015-03-18Z

Copyright © 2015 Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This Transitive Grace Period Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given work (the "Work") that bears a
notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the
file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

The purpose of this Exception is to allow you to delay the
GPL-licensing of the source code of a derived work of The Work for a
limited time.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

   You have permission to delay the GPL-licensing of the source code
   of a derived work of The Work for up to 12 months from the time
   that the GPLv3 (section 5) would otherwise require you to
   GPL-license the derived work, *provided* that you apply this same
   Exception to the license of your derived work upon GPL-licensing of
   your derived work.

2. No Weakening of The Work's Copyleft.

   The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
   presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
   requirements of the license of The Work.
